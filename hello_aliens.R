cat("Hello Aliens,

If you're reading this message, it means you have encountered humanity. On behalf of all the humans, let me welcome you to our planet.
You have much to learn about how our species lives. On that note, I will share two general themes about us:

    1) We are driven by self interest
    2) We keep moving forward

The first theme is the weakness of humanity. Although we all pretend it is a just world and that we want what is best
for everyone, the truth is it is not a just world and we want what's best for ourselves. Due to this, you will find competing interests
in every corner of earth. 

The second theme is the strength of humanity. No matter how severe the obstacle, humans will keep trying to find a way through. This means
you will find inspiring individuals that do their best to defy factors beyond their control everywhere.

With humanity, you can chose to see the cup as half empty or half full. What about yourselves?")
